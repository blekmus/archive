## Sync two folders

[Source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/203846/how-to-sync-two-folders-with-command-line-tools)

~~~ bash 
# puts folder A into folder B
rsync -avuc --delete "/home/user/A" "/home/user/B"

# puts contents of folder A to folder B
rsync -avuc --delete "/home/user/A/" "/home/user/B"

~~~
-a       - do the sync preserving all filesystem attributes
-v       - run verbosely
-u       - only copy files with a newer modification time (or size difference if the times are equal)
-c       - checksum both folders before transferring for cases where above fails
--delete - delete the files in target folder that do not exist in the source

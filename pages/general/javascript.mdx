## Methods

All of these achieve the same thing.

``` js
const o = {
  fn: function () {
      // do something
  }
}

const o = {
  fn: () => {
      // do something
  }
}

const o = {
  fn () {
      // do something
  }
}

// run - do something
o.fn
```

## Base of Full Pathname

``` js
const path = require('path')
const file = '/home/user/dir/file.txt'

path.parse(file).base // file.txt
path.basename(file) // file.txt
```

## React

### Variable New Lines Omitted

There are times when you have a variable with new lines. When you display this variable `<span>{someText}</span>` normally. The result is as if those `\n`s didn't even exist. The solution is simple. Just stick this in the css of the text.

``` js
style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }}
```

### Unsupported Attributes

Including attribute with empty quotes does the trick[^1].

``` html
<input directory="" webkitdirectory="" type="file" />
```

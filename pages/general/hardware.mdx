## Decrease libinput Sensitivity

You can simply change the touchpad speed or how fast the cursor moves from the settings but you can't change the sensitivity of gestures and two finger navigation. To do this you need to reduce the sensitivity density

First get the touchpad size

```bash
libinput list-devices | grep Size
```

Then measure the touchpad and generate a custom config/snippet. The size here should be a division of the size returned from the above command.

```bash
sudo libinput measure touchpad-size 20x45
```

Now copy the snippet between the equal marks and paste it in the following file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-evdev-local.hwdb
```

Now update hwdb

```bash
sudo systemd-hwdb update
sudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event*
```

Finally reboot to view changes

```bash
reboot
```

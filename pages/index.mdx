### What is this?

This is basically [my](https://github.com/blekmus) unix and everything techy knowledge base.
I made this to help lessen the blow from my retarded memory retention abilities.

The site is hosted on Github Pages and is built using [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) with a few custom react components scattered here and there. 

### Sites

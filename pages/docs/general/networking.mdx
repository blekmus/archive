## Find IP Address

### Private IP

Find private IP address of device. This address is used to access a self hosted service from within the same wifi or local network. Any application hosted locally on `0.0.0.0` is shared on this address.

```bash
# get private ip address
# if this returns two entries, ignore loopback ip (127.0.0.1)
# ignore everything after the slash
nmcli -p device show | grep "IP4.ADDRESS"

# or

# ip is the inet of the currently active interface
ip addr
```

```bash
# check if firewalls are disabled, they can cause issues here
sudo ufw status
```

### Public IP

Find externally accessible public IP address of device.

```bash
curl ifconfig.me # ipv4
curl ipinfo.io/ip # ipv4
curl api.ipify.org # ipv4
curl ident.me # ipv6
```

### Port Forwarding

```bash
ssh -N -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80 user@server.com
```

The command above attaches the server's port 80 to local port `8888`. Meaning if a site is hosted on port `80` on the server. I can view it by going to `127.0.0.1:8888` on my browser.

The command above doesn't give any output. So if there isn't anything, that means its probably working as intended.

## Service Ports

If ports aren't defined for inbuilt services at `/etc/services`, all of the tools that depend on it fail. Use [this](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/network-services-ports) link if anything happens to it. Simply paste in everything.

## NTP

With the following UFW rules should be present for NTP to work correctly.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 123/udp
sudo ufw allow out 123/udp
sudo ufw allow out 53
```

UDP port `123` is allowed for both incoming and outgoing traffic to NTP work. Additionally TCP port `53` (DNS) is opened for outgoing traffic since `/etc/ntp.conf` contains domain names of NTP servers.

!!! error ""
If `Servname not supported for ai_socktype and ntp` is displayed when starting NTP. The service file is probably fucked. Check out how to replace it [here](#service-ports). More info [here](https://www.ducea.com/2006/09/11/error-servname-not-supported-for-ai_socktype/).


## BunkerWeb ModSecurity Tuning

If a service is being blocked by modsecurity core rule set, you'll need to add an exception.
First check the specific url that's being blocked. You can do this through the network tab in the browser or the BunkerWeb docker logs. It should look like this;

```yml
bunkerweb | [warn] ModSecurity: Warning. Matched "Operator `Rx' ... [id "99999"] ... request: "POST /api/graphql"
bunkerweb | [error] ModSecurity: Access denied with code 403 (phase 2). Matched ... [id "949110"]
```

First a rule by the id `99999` is matched against a request that was made to the website. This is marked as a warning by modsecurity. After that a new rule `949110` is created on the fly by the server against the client IP to block it access to `/api/graphql`.

So the rule we need to exclude is `99999`. Sometimes it might be one rule or it might be a chain with multiple rules that need to be excluded. 

Here I'm excluding rules with id `99999` and `88888` for the domain `example.com` for the path `/api/graphql` by creating a new rule with id `1000100` and naming it graphql. 

```yml
environment:
	- example.com_CUSTOM_CONF_MODSEC_CRS_graphql=
	SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "^/api/graphql" "id:1000100,phase:1,pass,nolog,ctl:ruleRemoveById=99999,ctl:ruleRemoveById=88888"
```

! To avoid conflicts, use rule ids past 1,000,000. Only 1-99,999 are reserved for CRS but this ensures there won't be any conflicts any time soon.

## Ghost

By default the port is set to `2369`. If you visit that port, it'd show nothing. The correct port is `2368`

## <Red>Troubleshooting</Red>

#### `ssh Received disconnect from port <port>:2: Too many authentication failures`

One major cause for this error is having multiple keys in your .ssh directory. When encountering this, either specify the key you want to use or add the key to the ssh config.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@host
```

```bash
Host example.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentitiesOnly=yes
```

#### `Error connecting to agent: Permission denied` when trying to run `ssh-add`

First check if the key permissions are correct. You want both the key folder and the key itself to only be readable by the user. This is recommended.

```bash
chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
```

If the file's permissions aren't the issue, there can be several other causes. You could have incorrect permissions set on any of the directories ~/.ssh or ~/.ssh/keyfolder (technically also on ~ but then this wouldn't be the only symptom). Use ls -adl to inspect those directories. They should have rwx for you, but --- for both group and world.

Another issue could be (but this is quite rare) is that the ssh-add binary has the setuid bit set, causing it to run as a different user, and hence have no right to read your private key. Use `ls -lh $(which ssh-add)` to inspect this. If it returns an agent instance run by a different user. Kill it running `ssh-agent -k` after logging in as that user.

### Docker host access from container

First you need this line in your service

```yml
extra_hosts:
	- host.docker.internal:host-gateway
```

Second, anywhere you use the URI needs to have "host.docker.internal" rather than "localhost" or the IP.

Third, ufw needs to have access to the network subnet. To do this first check which network was created by compose for this using `docker network ls`. Then use `docker network inspect <name>`. After this take the subnet under IPAM and run the following. The host port is the port you're trying to forward from the localhost to the docker container.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <subnet-w-cidr> to any port <host-port>
```

### Expose container only via Tailscale

Because Docker deals with iptables straight rather than going through UFW, any firewall rules set wouldn't affect a docker mapped port. To ensure your Docker container is only accessible via Tailscale and not via the host's IP address, you can configure a Docker container to only listen on the Tailscale network interface.

**Find the Tailscale IP Address** <br />
On the Docker host, run `tailscale ip` to get the Tailscale IP address (e.g., `100.x.x.x`).

**Modify Docker Daemon Configuration** <br />
Create or edit the Docker daemon configuration file, usually located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
Add the following configuration to bind Docker to the Tailscale network interface:

```json
{ "hosts": ["fd://", "tcp://100.x.x.x:2375"] }
```

This binds Docker to the Tailscale IP on port `2375` (you can use any available port).

**Override default Configuration in Systemd** <br />
Edit the Docker service configuration file and remove the hosts flag:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit docker
```

```bash
### Anything between...
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
### Lines below...
```

Restart the Docker daemon to apply the changes

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

**Run Docker Container Bound to Tailscale Interface** <br />
When you run your Docker container, bind it to the Tailscale IP and the desired port (e.g., `5001`):

```bash
docker run -p 100.x.x.x:5001:5001
 your-docker-image
```

Now configure the firewall. Unless the default rule is `deny (incoming)` block it using `sudo ufw deny 5001`

## Compose Files

### PHP Server

This is a simple PHP server with Nginx as a reverse proxy. The PHP server is running on port 9000 and Nginx is running on port 8080. The PHP server is using the `php:8.2-fpm` image and the Nginx server is using the `nginx:latest` image. The PHP server is mounted to the `./html/` directory and the Nginx server is mounted to the `./nginx/conf.d/` directory.

### MySQL Server

This is a simple MySQL server running on port 3306. The MySQL server is mounted to the `./mysql/` directory.

```yml filename="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3"
name: mysql-server
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    ports:
      - "3306:3306" # local:container
    networks:
      - internal
    volumes:
      - ./mysql/:/var/lib/mysql/ # local:container
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root # set the root password
```

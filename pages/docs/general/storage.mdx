## Storage Usage

Start by running this to see which root path is taking up the most space.

``` sh
du -cha --max-depth=1 / | grep -E "^[0-9\.]*[MG]"
```

The `[MG]` limits the lines to be either MBs or GBs. If your disk is big enough add add `T` as well for TBs.

The command might return some errors on `/proc`, `/sys`, and `/dev` since they are not real files on disk. However, it should still provide valid output for the rest of the directories in root. After finding the biggest directory, rerun the command again narrow down the search.

For example, if `/var` takes up unnecessary space, run this next.

``` sh
du -cha --max-depth=1 /var | grep -E "^[0-9\.]*[MG]"
```

### Commands 

``` bash
# 10 largest files in /var
du -ah /var | sort -n -r | head -n 10

# mount disk usage and availability
df -h

# storage usage visualization
ncdu
```


## Unlinked Storage Hogging

Display pid of resources that processes are holding onto even if the origin is deleted.

``` bash
lsof | grep deleted | awk '{print $2}'
```

Applications using unlinked files can be printed using `lsof +L1`. Removing those files using their ids and killing the processes holding them.

``` sh
# Extract the processes
lsof | grep deleted | awk '{print $2}' > ids
```
``` sh
#!/bin/bash
input="./ids"
while IFS= read -r line
do
  kill -9 "$line"
done < "$input"
```

## Recursive Delete

To delete a specific file recursively from current directory and all sub directories

``` bash
find . -name "*.bak" -type f -delete

# run this first just to be safe
# it will list all files to be deleted
find . -name "*.bak" -type f
```

<Warning>
  Make sure that `-delete` is the last argument of the command. If you put it before the `-name *.bak` argument, it will __delete everything__.
</Warning>

## Site Permissions

Site permissions when popping up a new site.

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data loc/
sudo chmod -R 774 loc/
```

## Manual Fonts

For a single user place fonts in:

```sh
~/.local/share/fonts
```

For system-wide fonts place them in:

```sh
/usr/local/share/fonts

# don't touch this
# it's only for pacman
/usr/share/fonts/
```

## Tar

Compress a file into zst. You need `zstd` installed.

```bash
tar acf files.tar.zst files/
```

Decompress a file from zst

```bash
tar axf files.tar.zst
```

## Specific Sized Files

Create a file with a specific size. Write the size as `5M` or `10G`.

```bash
truncate -s <size> <file.txt>
```

## Binary Executables

To run binary executables from the terminal without having to specify the full path, you can add the directory containing the executable to the `PATH` environment variable. This can be done mainly in two ways.

First by adding the path of the executable into your respective shell's config file. 

``` bash
# bash
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/executable" >> ~/.bashrc

# fish
echo "set -gx PATH $PATH /path/to/executable" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Second by moving the executable into a directory that is already in the `PATH` variable. Like `/usr/local/bin`. This is the recommended way. 

``` bash
sudo mv /path/to/executable /usr/local/bin
```

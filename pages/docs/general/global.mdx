## Commands

```bash
# output linux version
cat "/proc/version"

# connect to a docker container terminal
docker exec -it <cont> bash

# strip and output only the selected column
awk '{print $<col_num>}'

# info about a pid
ps -Flww -p <pid>

# usernames used for logins
sudo lastb | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# switch between last cd's
nextd
prevd
cdh

# remove ssh key password
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# service specific logs
journalctl -eu <service>
```

## Sudo

One of the main things to do is to change the password asked when a user calls onto sudo. Making it ask for the root password is secure than the user pwd. So in the `/etc/sudoers` file;

``` bash
Defaults rootpw
```

Add a user to sudoers

```bash
usermod -a -G sudo <username>
```

### Root lock

Is root locked? If so, how do I unlock it?

Focus on the second column of this command. L means locked. P means there's a password or a password can be set.

``` bash
# check
sudo passwd -S root  # root P 09/02/2022 0 99999 7 -1

# unlock
sudo usermod -U root
sudo passwd root
```

### Sudo access

At the end of `/etc/sudoers` there is what appears to be a comment:

```
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
```

This includes sudo rules from files inside of `/etc/sudoers.d`. Here are some examples of rules that could be included in those files and what they mean.

```bash
# user ubuntu can run sudo without a password
ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

# members of admin group can sudo without a password
%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

# members of sudo group can sudo but needs password
%sudo  ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

Always use `visudo` to make edits to all of the mentioned files

```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users
```

Once you're done making edits, restart sudo to apply the changes

```bash
sudo service sudo restart
```

## Whitelisting

Whitelisting a command or set of commands for a group allows anyone who's in it to run them without `sudo`. This is done by creating a new file inside of `/etc/sudoers.d`. [Source](https://askubuntu.com/questions/930768/adding-local-content-in-etc-sudoers-d-instead-of-directly-modifying-sodoers-fi)

```bash
sudo visudo -f "/etc/sudoers.d/<file-name>"
```

Inside it the following properties whitelists the app. Remember to give the abs path for the application. Use `which <app-name>` to find it. [Source](https://askubuntu.com/questions/692701/allowing-user-to-run-systemctl-systemd-services-without-password)

```
Cmnd_Alias <SET-NAME> = <abs-app-path> command, <apb-app-path> command
%<group-name> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: <SET-NAME>
```

## System User

A user with no home directory, login shell nor password. It's basically a no-login dummy account made solely to containerize services.

```bash
# create a system user and group of the same name
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell=/sbin/nologin <username>

# set their permissions
sudo chown -R root:<username> /path/to/change
sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/change
```

## chsh

If you ever get the error;

```
chsh: PAM authentication failed
```

Find and comment this line inside `etc/pam.d/chsh`. [Source](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1702833)

```
auth required pam_shells.so
```

Then do whatever you were doing and make sure to **uncomment it again**.

## Groups

List all groups

```bash
getent group
```

Add user to a group

```bash
usermod -a -G group <username>
```

What groups is a user in. If there's no args, groups of current user are shown.

```bash
groups <user>
```

Create new group

```bash
groupadd <group>
```

Make sure to restart the services that are responsible for the groups after adding a user into one.

Necessary groups for reg user;

- docker
- sudo
- postfix

## GPG

Decrypt a file.

```bash
gpg --output <output-file> --decrypt <file.gpg>
```

Encrypt a file.

```bash
gpg --output <output-file.gpg> --encrypt <file>
```

Export public and private keys.

```bash
# public key
gpg --output <public.pgp> --armor --export -r <recipient>

# private key
gpg --output <private.pgp> --armor --export-secret-key -r <recipient>
```

## WSL

If this error comes up `[process exited with code 4294967295]` run this. [Source](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5092)

If the installed WSL `<distro>` is ubuntu 18.04, use `Ubuntu-20.04`

```bash
wsl --terminate <distro>
```

## Standard File Browser

You can define the default file browser by editing the file `~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list`. Open this file and change the line `inode/directory` as follows.

If this doesn't work, edit the same line in `usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache`. [Source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/333254/set-standard-file-browser-for-open-containing-folder)

```
inode/directory=nautilus.desktop;
```

## Terminal Sessions

[Source](https://haydenjames.io/kill-inactive-ssh-sessions/)

```bash
# currently logged in users
w -i
who -a -H

# login history
last

# login faliure history
lastb
```

SSH session process trees

```bash
pstree -p

├─sshd(3102)─┬─sshd(3649)───bash(3656)
│            └─sshd(16680)───bash(16687)───pstree(17073)


# to kill a terminal
kill 3649
```

## Mimetype

Display mimetype of a certain file.

```bash
mimetype "/file/path.ext"
```

Edit the following file to change default mimetype default application. [Source](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_MIME_Applications#mimeapps.list)

```bash
micro "~/.config/mimeapps.list"
```

## Kitty Terminal

When connecting to a host using ssh. Kitty gives a `'xterm-kitty': unknown terminal type.` error. To solve that you need to set the terminal `TERM` env variable to something other than the default. [Source](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1241)

```bash
# fish shell
set TERM xterm

# bash
export TERM=xterm
```

## Fish Shell

Add directory to PATH

```bash
fish_add_path /path/to/dir
```

### Sudo errors

When trying to `su` or running `sudo`, this error is given:

```
su: failed to execute /usr/local/bin/fish: No such file or directory
```

This happens when `/etc/passwd` has `/usr/local/bin/fish` as the user's default shell but that shell path doesn't exist. To fix it become root by using `sudo bash`. Then manually clean `/etc/passwd` of all traces of the non existent path.

## Firefox

Setting to know in `about:config`

```bash
# Touchpad vertical scroll sensivity
mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y

# Mousewheel vertical scroll sensitivity
mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount
```

## Extract Python Requirements

```python
# install tool
python3 -m pip install -U pipreqs

# go to script folder
pipreqs .
```

## Cronjobs

Setting up separate logging for cron. This however will not log the outputs of cron jobs. This is only for the cron process itself.

```bash
# open this file
micro /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf

# uncomment this line
cron.*

# restart syslog
sudo service rsyslog restart
```

After this, logs should appear in a separate file called `/var/log/cron.log`. Cron activity will now be logged to this file (in addition to syslog).

As for logging the output of cron jobs. Simply redirect command outputs.

```
01 14 * * * /home/joe/myscript >> /home/log/myscript.log 2>&1
```

This will redirect all standard output and errors that may be produced by the script that is run to the log file specified.

## Timeshift Backups

If automated backups aren't being created even if Timeshift is completely configured. A service called `cronie` might be disabled.

```bash
systemctl enable cronie.service
systemctl start cronie.service
```

That should hopefully solve this issue. To check if there's a problem with the Timeshift configuration itself.

```bash
sudo timeshift --check --scripted
```

Running this command will create a snapshot if one is due. You can see if this does create a snapshot from the GUI afterwards. If this command doesn't work then the problem is in configuration or user account/permissions.

[Source](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift/issues/396)

## Wireguard

``` bash
Error: IPv6 is disabled on nexthop device.
```

If you get this error when running `sudo wg-quick up <interface>`. This means that an ipv6 address is mentioned in the config file at `/etc/wireguard/<interface>`. This isn't a problem if the client device has ipv6 enabled. But if it's disabled then this error will come up. To fix this, simply remove the ipv6 address from the config's `AllowedIPs`.

``` ini
; before
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

; after
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```

## Dolby Vision

If you somehow find yourself with a Dolby Vision encoded video clip, but without a DV certified device. You can use mpv to color correct the video back to how it's supposed to look.

```bash
mpv --vo=gpu-next <video.mkv>
```

## Cisco Packet Tracer

In the MacOS specific issue where the CLI stdout is spoken out by Siri, first open up packet tracer in full screen and then click on the top left then the preferences option. A window will open up with a lot of options, in it tick the option "Disable CLI text to speech".


## Python IDLE

On MacOS if this error shows up when running `idle3` in the terminal.

```
** IDLE can't import Tkinter.
Your Python may not be configured for Tk. **
```

Tkinter needs to be installed using brew.

``` bash
brew install python-tk
```

## Mono Framework

On MacOS to remove the mono framework run this.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework
sudo pkgutil --forget com.xamarin.mono-MDK.pkg
sudo rm /etc/paths.d/mono-commands
```

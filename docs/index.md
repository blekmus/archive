## What is this?

This is basically [my](https://github.com/fire-walker) unix and everything techy knowledge base. I made this to help lessen the blow on my retarded memory retention abilities. 

This is hosted on Github Pages and is built using [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) with a customized theme based off of the superb [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme.

## Sites

Stuff I've sprung up over the course of my learning endeavors.

??? tip "AniTracker"
    One of the best things that happened to me during the pandemic was the boredom that came with staying at home all day. This made me explore a ton of new different technologies. One of them was the js library react. 

    This is the new and improved anime tracker v2. Built using React and hosted on Netlify. The site uses the Anilist GQL api to grab data and does it so using the Apollo Client.

??? tip "Birthday Tracker"
    When it comes to remembering birthdays, I suck at it. That's what inspired me to build this. Hosted on Netlify all the data it uses is saved in a nice AES encrypted package within the site's root directory. Even then, without a rightful backend notifications are impossible so this is what I'd consider a half baked solution.

??? tip "Mythicon - Demo"
    Made this for a competition a while back. Even though I wasn't able to grab a position within the top three with this. I'm still proud of the design.

??? tip "Old Anime Tracker"
    The vanilla js, html and scss based predecessor to the current Anime Tracker.

    This was the result of me trying to put my love for anime together with my enthusiasm for API based site architectures. This is based on Anilist, a site I'm a very big fan of. From it's designs to it's wonderful color scheme. Which in essence is what inspired this docs' color scheme as well. So basically, the team behind Anilist made a pretty wonderful GQL based API to access their site data. And me, wanting to try my hand with some AJAX using JS, used that opportunity to make this thing. It's simply a stripped down anime viewer.

## What is this?

This is basically [my](https://github.com/fire-walker) unix knowledge base. I'll continue to update this documentation to help lessen the blow on my retarded memory retention abilities. 

This documentation is hosted on Github Pages and is built using [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) with a customized theme based off of the superb [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme.

If you're viewing this and feel like I've made a mistake. Please click that repo icon and shoot me a pull request. I'd appriciate any help.


## Sites

Shit I've sprung up that may or may not be relevant to anyone, other than yours truly. All of these are hosted on Netlify with CNAMEs of my sub domains pointed towards them.

??? tip "Anime Tracker"
    One of the best things that happened to me during the pandemic was the boredem that came with staying at home all day. This made me explore a ton of new different technologies. One of them was the js library react. 

    This is the new and improved anime tracker v2. Built using React and hosted on Netlify. The site uses the Anilist GQL api and accesses it using the Apollo Client.

??? tip "Birthday Tracker"
    When it comes to remembering birthdays. I suck at it. So, I first made a discord bot. It worked fine up until I had to give up my server. Then as a replacement I made this site. It's got no backend so, all the data is saved right in a nice AES encrypted package within the site's root directory. Even then, without a rightful backend notifications are impossible. Which is why my next big project, an android app made using Kotlin, should probably be _the_ solution for this dilemma.

??? tip "Mythicon - Demo"
    Made this for a competition a while back. Even though I wasn't able to grab a position within the top three with this. I'm still proud of the design.

??? tip "Old Anime Tracker"
    The vanilla js, html and scss based predecessor to the current Anime Tracker.

    This was the result of me trying to put my love for anime together with my enthusiasm for API based site architectures. This is based on Anilist, a site I'm a very big fan of. From it's designs to it's wonderful color scheme. Which in essence is what inspired this docs' color scheme as well. So basically, the team behind Anilist made a pretty wonderful GQL based API to access their site data. And me, wanting to try my hand with some AJAX using JS, used that opportunity to make this thing. It's simply a stripped down anime viewer.

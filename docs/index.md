## What is this?

This is basically [my](https://github.com/fire-walker) unix knowledge base. I'll continue to update this documentation to help lessen the blow on my retarded memory retention abilities. 

This documentation is hosted on Github Pages and is built using [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) with a customized theme based off of the superb [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme.

If your viewing this and you feel like I've made a mistake. Please click that repo icon and shoot me a pull request. I'd appriciate any help.


## Sites

Shit I've sprung up that may or may not be relevant to anyone, other than yours truly. All of these are hosted on Netlify with CNAMEs of my sub domains pointed towards them.


??? tip "Anilist Tracker"
    This was the result of me trying to put my love for anime together with my enthusiasm with API based site architectures. Anilist, a site I'm a very big fan of. From it's designs to their wonderful color scheme. Which in essence is what inspired this docs' color scheme as well. So basically, the team behind Anilist made a pretty wonderful GQL based API to access their site data. And me, wanting to try my hand with some AJAX using JS, using that opportunity to make this. It's simply a stripped down anime viewer.

??? tip "Birthday Tracker"
    When it comes to remembering birthdays, I suck at it. So, I first made a discord bot. It worked fine up until I had to give up my server. Then as a replacement I made this site. It's got no backend so, all the data is saved right in a nice AES encrypted package within the site's root directory. Even then, without a rightful backend notifications are impossible. Which is why my next big project, an android app made using Kotlin, should probably be _the_ solution for this dilemma.

??? tip "Mythicon - Demo"
    Made this for a competition a while back. Even though I wasn't able to grab a position within the top three with this. I'm still proud of the design.
